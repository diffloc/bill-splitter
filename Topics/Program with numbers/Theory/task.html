<h2>Program with numbers</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Programs in which there's nothing to calculate are quite rare. Therefore, learning to program with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8804" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a number is a value that can be used in arithmetic operations. | It can't be an abstract thing, like in math, because a computer should be able to work with it. Python supports various types of numbers, including integers, float (floating-point numbers), and complex numbers. These numbers can be used in arithmetic operations, comparisons, and other mathematical tasks.">numbers</a> is never a bad idea. An even more valuable skill we are about to learn is the processing of user data. With its help, you can create interactive and by far more flexible applications. So let's get started!</p>
<h5 id="reading-numbers-from-user-input" style="text-align: center;">Reading numbers from user input</h5>
<p>Since you have become familiar with the <code class="language-python">input()</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return one or more values. They help in breaking down large programs into smaller and manageable tasks, making the code more readable and maintainable. Functions can be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to test and debug.">function</a> in Python, it's hardly new to you that any data passed to this function is treated as a <strong>string</strong>. But how should we deal with numerical values? As a general rule, they are explicitly converted to corresponding <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, numerical types are used to represent and manipulate numerical values. | There are several numerical types, including integers, float (floating point numbers), and complex numbers. Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative, without decimals. Floats are real numbers with decimal points. Complex numbers are numbers with a real and imaginary component, denoted by a + bi.">numerical types</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">integer = int(input())
floating_point = float(input())</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to current best practices: it's crucial not to name your <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A variable in Python is a named location used to store data in memory. | It is created when a name is bound to a value for the first time, and it can be assigned and reassigned different values throughout the execution of a program. Variables in Python follow specific naming rules, such as not starting with a digit, not being a keyword, and using underscores or digits. They are objects in Python, meaning they have a unique identity and are created, assigned, passed, and returned like any other object.">variables</a> as built-in types (say, <strong>float </strong>or <strong>int</strong>). Also, we should take into account user mistakes: if a user types an inaccurate input, say, a string '<samp>two</samp>' instead of a number <samp>2</samp>, a <code class="language-python">ValueError</code> will occur. At the moment, we won't focus on it; but don't worry, more information about <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6052" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An error in Python is a problem that occurs while the program is running, which prevents it from executing correctly. | These issues are usually caused by logical mistakes in the code, and they can be identified by the error messages that Python displays. These messages often include details about the type of error, the location in the code where it occurred, and sometimes even a suggested fix. Understanding and addressing these errors is a crucial part of the programming process, as they can provide valuable insights into how the code is functioning and where improvements can be made.">errors</a> is available in a dedicated topic. Now, consider a more detailed and pragmatic example of handling numerical <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5913" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, input refers to the process of obtaining data or values from a user or another source. | This is typically done through the `input()` function, which prompts the user to enter a value and then returns that value as a string. However, input can also come from other sources such as files or external devices. The concept of input is important in Python because it allows programs to interact with users and receive data that can be processed and used to produce results.">inputs</a>.</p>
<h5 id="free-air-miles" style="text-align: center;">Free air miles</h5>
<p>Imagine you have a credit card with a free air miles bonus program (or maybe you already have one). As a user, you are expected to input the amount of money you spend on average from this card per month. Let's assume that the bonus program gives you 2 free air miles for every dollar you spend. Here's a simple program to figure out when you can travel somewhere for free:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># the average amount of money per month
money = int(input("How much money do you spend per month: "))

# the number of miles per unit of money
n_miles = 2

# earned miles
miles_per_month = money * n_miles

# the distance between London and Paris
distance = 215

# how many months do you need to get
# a free trip from London to Paris and back
print(distance * 2 / miles_per_month)</code></pre>
<p>This program will calculate how many months it takes to travel the selected distance and back.</p>

<h5 id="advanced-forms-of-assignment" style="text-align: center;">Advanced forms of assignment</h5>
<p>Whenever you use an equal sign <code class="language-python">=</code>, you actually assign some value to a variable. For that reason, <code class="language-python">=</code> is typically referred to as an <strong>assignment operator</strong>. Meanwhile, there are other assignment operators you can use in Python. They are also called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/37669" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The compound assignment operator in Python is a shorthand notation for performing arithmetic operations and assignment in a single step. | It combines the standard arithmetic operation with the assignment operator (=), such as +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, and **=. These operators work by updating the value of the variable on the left side based on the operation and the value on the right side. For example, in the expression 'x += 3', the value of 'x' is incremented by 3.">compound assignment operators</a></strong>, for they carry out an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7444" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Arithmetic operations in Python include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer division, and exponentiation. | These operations can be combined in more complex expressions, and Python also supports a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are combinations of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Python follows a specific priority for these operations, and the style for writing expressions is outlined in PEP.">arithmetic operation</a> and assignment in one step. Have a look at the code snippet below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># simple assignment
number = 10
number = number + 1  # 11</code></pre>
<p>This code is equivalent to the following one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># compound assignment
number = 10
number += 1  # 11</code></pre>
<p>One can clearly see from the example that the second piece of code is more concise (for it doesn't repeat the variable's <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a name is a unique identifier given to a variable, function, or any other object. | It's essentially a label that distinguishes one object from another in the same scope. This concept is not unique to Python, as most programming languages have some form of naming system for their entities. However, Python's dynamic typing and use of names as references to objects, rather than directly storing values, make its naming system particularly important to understand.">name</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally, similar assignment forms exist for the rest of arithmetic operations: <code class="language-python">-=</code>, <code class="language-python">*=</code>, <code class="language-python">/=</code>, <code class="language-python">//=</code>, <code class="language-python">%=</code>, <code class="language-python">**=</code>. Given the opportunity, use them to save time and effort.</p>

<h5 id="counter-variable" style="text-align: center;">Counter variable</h5>
<p>In programming, there is a concept called <em><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6302" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A loop in Python is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. | It's a way to automate repetitive tasks, making your code more efficient. Loops can be used with iterable objects, such as lists, strings, or dictionaries, and they can be nested or controlled by functions to customize the number of iterations. The two main types of loops in Python are 'for' loops and 'while' loops.">loop</a></em>. It is used to repeat some <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6270" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A block of code in Python refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> a certain number of times. Pretty often they have special variables called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/30244" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a 'counter' is a variable used in a loop to keep track of the number of iterations that have been completed. | It is often initialized to zero and incremented by one in each iteration of the loop. If the counter variable is not used within the loop, it can be replaced with an underscore to indicate that it is not being utilized. Counters are useful for repeating a function a specified number of times or for iterating over a collection a certain number of times. They are an essential part of programming in Python and many other languages.">counters</a> </strong>alongside them. A <strong>counter</strong>, as the name presupposes,<strong> </strong>counts something: how many times a condition is met, how many elements in the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6177" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a sequence is a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a particular order. | It includes lists, tuples, and strings. Sequences are characterized by their ability to be indexed, sliced, and iterated over. Indexing allows you to access individual elements of the sequence by their position, slicing allows you to extract a subset of the sequence, and iteration allows you to loop through the elements of the sequence. Sequences are also immutable, meaning that once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.">sequence</a>, etc. Hence, counters should be integers. Now we are getting to the point: you can use the operators <code class="language-python">+=</code> and <code class="language-python">-=</code> to increase or decrease the counter respectively.</p>
<p>Consider this example where a user determines the value by which the counter is increased:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">counter = 1
step = int(input())  # let it be 3
counter += step
print(counter)  # it should be 4</code></pre>
<p>In case you need only non-negative integers from the user (we are increasing the counter after all!), you can prevent incorrect inputs by using the <code class="language-python">abs()</code> function. It is a Python built-in function that <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'return' is a statement used to exit a function and optionally specify a value to be returned to the caller. | If no value is specified, 'None' is returned by default. The execution of the function stops after the first 'return' statement encountered, even if there are more statements in the function body. The returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in expressions, depending on the context.">returns</a> the absolute value of a number (that is, value regardless of its sign). Let's readjust our last program a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">counter = 1
step = abs(int(input()))  # user types -3
counter += step
print(counter)  # it's still 4</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, thanks to the <code class="language-python">abs()</code> function we got a positive number.</p>
