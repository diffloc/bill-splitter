# OBJECTIVE:

In this stage your program should perform the following steps:

    1.  Take user input â€” how many people want to join, including the user;
    2.  In case of an invalid number of people (zero or negative),
        "No one is joining for the party" is expected as an output;
    3.  Otherwise, take the friends' names as input, iteratively;
    4.  Store them in a dictionary initialized with zeros;
    5.  Take user input - bill total.
    6.  Ask user if they want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature
        - if 'Yes': Choose random friend from dict
            - Distribute bill across unlucky friends, lucky friend pays zero
        - if 'No' (or not 'Yes'): Output "No one is going to be lucky"
            - Distribute bill equally across all friends
    7.  Print out the dictionary.
