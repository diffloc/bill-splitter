<h2>Taking user's input</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes programs need to interact with users, either to receive some data or to deliver some sort of result. And that's when the <code class="language-python">input()</code><strong> </strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return one or more values. They help in breaking down large programs into smaller and manageable tasks, making the code more readable and maintainable. Functions can be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to test and debug.">function</a> steals the show.</p><h5 id="reading-input-from-a-user">Reading input from a user</h5><p>The <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, input refers to the process of obtaining data or values from a user or another source. | This is typically done through the `input()` function, which prompts the user to enter a value and then returns that value as a string. However, input can also come from other sources such as files or external devices. The concept of input is important in Python because it allows programs to interact with users and receive data that can be processed and used to produce results.">input</a> data we want to get is nothing but some value entered by the user. The <code class="language-python">input()</code> function reads this value and returns it in a program as a string. For example, the following program reads the user name and prints a greeting.</p><pre><code class="language-python">user_name = input()
print('Hello, ' + user_name)</code></pre><p>In the first line, the program will wait for the user to enter something as input. We'll <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/37669" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'assign' refers to the process of giving a value to a variable. | This is a fundamental concept in programming, as variables allow you to store and manipulate data. In Python, you can assign values to variables using the equals sign (=). For example:

```
x = 5
```

In this case, the value 5 is assigned to the variable x. Python creates a new object, places the value 5 inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name x to the object.">assign</a> this input to a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A variable in Python is a named location used to store data in memory. | It is created when a name is bound to a value for the first time, and it can be assigned and reassigned different values throughout the execution of a program. Variables in Python follow specific naming rules, such as not starting with a digit, not being a keyword, and using underscores or digits. They are objects in Python, meaning they have a unique identity and are created, assigned, passed, and returned like any other object.">variable</a> to save it for later. In the second line, the program appends the entered <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a name is a unique identifier given to a variable, function, or any other object. | It's essentially a label that distinguishes one object from another in the same scope. This concept is not unique to Python, as most programming languages have some form of naming system for their entities. However, Python's dynamic typing and use of names as references to objects, rather than directly storing values, make its naming system particularly important to understand.">name</a> to the end of the <code class="language-python">'Hello, '</code> string and prints the whole phrase as a result.</p><p>If a user enters <code class="language-python">Sauron</code>, this program <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7139" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The 'print' function in Python is a built-in function used to output data to the standard output device (like a screen). | It can take various types of arguments, such as strings, integers, lists, etc. By default, the output is separated by spaces and ends with a newline. However, you can customize the separator and end character using the 'sep' and 'end' keyword arguments, respectively. Additionally, the 'print' function can handle multiple arguments, printing them out sequentially with the specified separator and end character.">prints</a>:</p><pre><code class="language-python">Hello, Sauron</code></pre><p>So, your program prints a result that depends on the user's input (name).</p><h5 id="clear-messages">Clear messages</h5><p>It is highly recommended to state clearly what type of input we expect from our users. To do so, the <code class="language-python">input()</code> function may take an optional <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5891" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an argument is a value that is passed into a function when it is called. | It is used to provide data to the function so that it can perform its intended task. Arguments can be passed either positionally or by keyword, and they can be required or optional. When defining a function, you can specify default values for optional arguments, which allows the function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept. Additionally, Python functions can accept a variable number of arguments using the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax.">argument</a>, that is, a message:</p><pre><code class="language-python">user_name = input('Please, enter your name: ')
print('Hello, ' + user_name)</code></pre><p>The program starts, the user sees the message, enters their name, and gets the result as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Please, enter your name: Sauron
Hello, Sauron</code></pre><p>Another way to do this is to print the message separately: </p><pre><code class="language-python">print('Enter your name: ')
user_name = input()
print('Hello, ' + user_name)</code></pre><p>There's no big difference actually: in the previous example, the input will be printed in the same line as the message, while in this case it will be entered on the next line. So, you may choose whatever you like.</p><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Although it is recommended to print messages for users, avoid them in our educational programming challenges, otherwise your code may not pass our tests.</p></div><p></p><h5 id="important-details">Important details</h5><p>Let's dig into some details.</p><p>First of all, how long can the user's input be, and how does the program understand that the person entered everything they wanted? Here's a thing about the <code class="language-python">input()</code> function: as soon as the program has started executing this function, it stops and waits for the user to enter some value and <strong>press Enter</strong>. That also means that if there's no input from the user, the program will not execute any further.</p><p>What else should you remember? Well, this: any value you enter, the function sees as a <strong>string</strong>. It doesn't matter if you enter digits or letters, the input will be converted to a string.</p><p>If you want an input to be a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8804" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a number is a value that can be used in arithmetic operations. | It can't be an abstract thing, like in math, because a computer should be able to work with it. Python supports various types of numbers, including integers, float (floating-point numbers), and complex numbers. These numbers can be used in arithmetic operations, comparisons, and other mathematical tasks.">number</a></strong>, you should write it explicitly:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("What's your favorite number?")
