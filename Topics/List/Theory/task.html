Other collections include tuples, sets, and dictionaries, each with their own unique properties for storing elements.">group</a> several elements in order to process them as a single object. For this, you will need to use different collections. One of the most important and useful <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10014" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a collection is a data structure used to store and manage data. | There are four main types of collections: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Each collection has its own unique properties and use cases. Lists and tuples are both sequence types, meaning they store elements in a specific order. The main difference between them is that lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, while tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once they are set.">collections</a> in Python is a <strong>list</strong>.</p><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><h5 id="creating-and-printing-lists">Creating and printing lists</h5><p>Look at a simple list that stores several names of dogs' breeds:</p><pre><code class="language-python">dog_breeds = ['corgi', 'labrador', 'poodle', 'jack russell']
print(dog_breeds)  # ['corgi', 'labrador', 'poodle', 'jack russell']</code></pre><p>In the first line, we use square brackets to create a list that contains four elements and then <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/37669" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'assign' refers to the process of giving a value to a variable. | This is a fundamental concept in programming, as variables allow you to store and manipulate data. In Python, you can assign values to variables using the equals sign (=). For example:

```
x = 5
```

In this case, the value 5 is assigned to the variable x. Python creates a new object, places the value 5 inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name x to the object.">assign</a> it to the <code class="language-python">dog_breeds</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A variable in Python is a named location used to store data in memory. | It is created when a name is bound to a value for the first time, and it can be assigned and reassigned different values throughout the execution of a program. Variables in Python follow specific naming rules, such as not starting with a digit, not being a keyword, and using underscores or digits. They are objects in Python, meaning they have a unique identity and are created, assigned, passed, and returned like any other object.">variable</a>. In the second line, the list is printed through the variable's name. All the elements are printed in the same <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10059" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'ordered' generally refers to the fact that the elements of a collection have a specific order or sequence in which they appear. | This is in contrast to unordered collections, where the order of elements does not matter. In Python, examples of ordered collections include lists and strings, where each element has a specific index that corresponds to its position in the collection. Additionally, certain data structures like dictionaries can also maintain order of insertion in more recent versions of Python.">order</a> as they were stored in the list because lists are <strong>ordered</strong>.</p><p>Here is another list that contains five integers:</p><pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></pre><p>Another way to create a list is to invoke the <code class="language-python">list</code> function. It is used to create a list out of an <strong>iterable</strong> object: that is, a kind of object where you can get its <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/36290" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an element is a single item in a collection such as a list, tuple, set, or dictionary. | It can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, booleans, or even other collections.

The concept of iterability will be explained in detail further on, but let's look at the examples below:</p><pre><code class="language-python">list_out_of_string = list('danger!')
print(list_out_of_string)  # ['d', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'r', '!']

list_out_of_integer = list(235)  # TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable</code></pre><p>So, the <code class="language-python">list</code> function creates a list containing each element from the given <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6065" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An iterable object in Python is a data type that has a specific behavior: it can be looped over. | This means that you can iterate through its elements one by one, either manually or using a loop statement. Common examples of iterable objects are lists, strings, and dictionaries. Iterables implement a method that returns an iterator, which is an object that can traverse the iterable and return its elements one by one. Iterators represent a stream of data, and they implement the method that returns the next item of the iterable.">iterable object</a>. For now, remember that a <strong>string </strong>is an example of an <strong>iterable </strong>object, and an <strong>integer </strong>is an example of a <strong>non-iterable</strong> object. A <strong>list </strong>itself is also an <strong>iterable </strong>object.</p><p>Let's also note the difference between the <code class="language-python">list</code> function and creating a list using <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6189" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Square brackets in Python are used for various purposes such as indexing, slicing, list comprehension, and defining generator expressions. | Indexing is used to access individual elements of ordered sequences like lists and strings by their position, where the index starts from zero.

An empty list can be created using square brackets with nothing inside, like this: [] or by using the `list()` function with no arguments, like this: `list()`. An empty list is still a list object, it just doesn't have any elements in it.">empty lists</a></strong> that do not have elements at all.</p><pre><code class="language-python">empty_list_1 = list()

For example, a function can be defined with a specific data type for its argument, like 'def greet(name: str)'. The type of an object can be determined using the 'type()' function.">different types</a></strong> of elements, including other lists. So there are neither restrictions, nor fixed list types, and you can add to your list any data you want, like in the following example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">different_objects = ['a', 1, 'b', 2, [1, 2, 3]]</code></pre><h5 id="length-of-a-list">Length of a list</h5><p>Sometimes you need to know how many elements are there in a list.
